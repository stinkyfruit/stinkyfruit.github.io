Hey You! Thanks for stumbling upon my site. A little bit about myself... I graduated from Tulane University with a Finance degree with a specialization in Information Systems. I've always been interested in programming, and I actually started my college career as a Computer Science major; however Katrina hit New Orleans, and there was a major reorgination of the science department, and Computer Science said bye bye. So I switched to business.

I worked at Morgan Stanley in their Information Security department and was promoted to team lead and manager after 2 years. I moved back home to New Orleans and am looking to start over with a career in my true passion, technology. 

I'm currently going through the Hack Reactor program, and am amazed at how much I am learning in such a short amount of time.
